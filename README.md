# Text_Classification_RNN
For this project we seek to classify the topic of scientific journal abstracts (supervised learning). The possible topics for each abstract are Information Theory, Computer Vision, and Mathamatics. These three classes can only take Boolean values, ‘1’ if it is classified as the topic and ‘0’ if not. Thus, we will create separate models for each of the three classes.
